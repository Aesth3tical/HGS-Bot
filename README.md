# HGS-Bot
Made for the now-defunct HistoricalGovSim [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/@me) server, no longer maintained. Feel free to submit a pull request if you really want to, or fork the bot to use in your own gov sim.

### Disclaimer:
- This bot was never completed, as I didn't see a point in completing it after the server it was for closed. If you do use it in your own server, please either finish or remove the features which are incomplete (economics)
- I will not provide any support in getting the bot online, its faily simple ``git clone https://github.com/Aesth3tical/HGS-Bot && node src/index.js`` so you shouldn't have issues really, if you have issues with the database feel free to change it, I don't work with quick.db regularly nowadays so I am not a good source for help with that. You can try their Discord server - [here](https://discord.gg/plexidev)
